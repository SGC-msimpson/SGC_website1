      <h2>Initial Phase</h2>
      <p>
      The initial phase of the skin genetics consortium is focused on defining the landscape of common genetic variation that contributes to the risk of developing common skin diseases and traits across global populations. </p>
      <p>
      This initial project is funded by the Leo Foundation. We are working closely with population-scale biobanks across the world to perform genetic analysis on skin conditions that are routinely collected in electronic health records.
      </p>
      <p>
      The results from this study will be made available through the Skin Knowledge portal and will form the basis of future studies investigating the shared and distinct components of genetic risk between diseases and use this information to understand the biological mechanisms of disease and how this information can be used to identify optimal therapeutic intervention strategies to improve health outcomes.
